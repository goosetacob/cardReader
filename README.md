This is a WebApp for Orgs within the Bourns College of Engineering at the University of California, Riverside to use in order to expediate their meetings.<br /> 

It take attandance by swiping a card using a USB Card Reader (something like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/MagTek-21040108-Magnetic-Keyboard-Emulation/dp/B0009XB10Q/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1395108800&sr=1-1&keywords=USB+swipe">this</a>) OR if the attendee dosen't have their card available, they can just manually type in their name. <br /> 

Once all attandance is taken, there is a convenient download button to save the attendace sheet as a .CSV file.<br /><br />

**Further development would be to integrate google docs to automatically save the attenance is the users Google Docs as a Google Speadsheet.
